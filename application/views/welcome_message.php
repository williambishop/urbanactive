                Our story started in 1970. My dad, Dr. Arthur Schulert, a professor of Biochemistry at Vanderbilt University Medical School, founded ESC when I was ten years old. ESC's first permanent location was a 2,000 sq. ft. building located at 1776 Mays Chapel Road in Mount Juliet, TN where we initially conducted several research contracts for the National Science Foundation. This was very interesting work and included developing a more accurate method for testing mercury in fish.
                <br/><br/>
                The EPA's Clean Water and Safe Drinking Water legislation of the early 1970s provided an additional market of Tennessee utilities and industries to the expanding array of analyses that the laboratory was performing. ESC grew slowly for several years by increasing our share of the drinking water and wastewater testing markets in Tennessee until we became, and continue as, the leading laboratory for Utilities testing in Tennessee.
                <br/><br/>
                I joined the lab in May of 1987 after getting my chemistry degree from the Naval Academy and serving 5 years in the service on nuclear submarines. I was the 6th person hired on staff at ESC when our annual revenue was $250,000.
                <br/><br/>
                Our earliest focus was on technology and how to make our lab more efficient and sustainable. We started by building our first LIMS system using IBM PCs with a Token Ring network and a Foxpro Database. Our LIMS and lab automation efforts included sample kit building, so that all of the container labels and chain of custody documents would be completed digitally and the bottles organized by Sample ID.

                We set up client remote access before the internet was available. We provided a bank of modems accessible via a toll-free number where our clients could download sample results in customized spreadsheets. This was the precursor to our current industry-leading data access tools that allow customers to design a table on the fly and save multiple views specific to their needs, including action limits from our comprehensive library of State and Federal regulatory limits.
                <br/><br/>
                In 1988, we began testing samples for the Underground Storage Tank program. The next year we added Biomonitoring testing capabilities.
