 * 
 * I am writing this script assuming that it is going to be run from the command
 * line and the user will be passing in the number to be validated.
 *
 * The Luhn algorithm, also known as the "modulus 10" or "mod 10" algorithm is a
 * simple checksum formula used to validate a variety of identification numbers,
 * such as credit card numbers, IMEI numbers, National Provider Identifier numbers
 * in the US, Canadian SSN's.
 *
 * The formula verifies a number against its included check digit, which is usually
 * appended to a partial account number to generate the full account number.  The
 * number must pass the following test
 *  1)  From the rightmost digit, which is the check digit, and moving left, double
 *      the value of every second digit. If the result of this doubling operation
 *      is greater than 9 (e.g., 8 Ã— 2 = 16), then add the digits of the product
 *      (e.g., 16: 1 + 6 = 7, 18: 1 + 8 = 9) or alternatively subtract 9 from the
 *      product (e.g., 16: 16 - 9 = 7, 18: 18 - 9 = 9).
 *  2)  Calculate the sum of the non-check digit numbers.
 *  3)  Mulitply the value in Step 2 by 9
 *  3)  Take the value from Step 3 and find its mod 10 value.  If that value equals
 *      the check digit value then the number is valid and passes.  Otherwise it is
 *      not valid and fails.
 *
 * I used https://www.freeformatter.com/credit-card-number-generator-validator.html
 * to get a list of random credit card number to verify this was working properly.
 * This page genearates new number everytime.  All the number that I tried from this
 * page worked as expected.
